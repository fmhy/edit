DDL   | Direct Download Link or simply direct download is a URL to content that can be directly downloaded by the user from a filehost.
DMCA takedown notice | A Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice is a legal request to remove infringing content from a website or online service.
DNS   | Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol that converts domain names to their IP addresses. Using a different DNS provider can allow you to bypass your ISP's blocking and also block some ads.
Download Manager   | A download manager is a computer program designed to download files from the Internet. It may also provide other functionalities like: Resume broken or paused downloads, mirroring (follow links in a website and download lots of files), get files from mirror sites, etc.
DRM   | DRM or Digital Rights Management is generally any software or media distribution scheme that seeks to limit a user's ability to copy, share, or view content (e.g. movies, video games, music, etc.), usually for the purpose of maintaining revenue from purchases of that content.
Encoding | Encoding is the process of converting data from one format to another. This can be done for many reasons, such as to make the data more compact, to improve compatibility, or to improve quality.
False Positive   | An instance in which antivirus software incorrectly classifies benign content as malicious. This is a common occurrence with cracked software, videogames and keygens.
Firewall | A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and permits or blocks data packets based on a set of security rules. Its purpose is to establish a barrier between your internal network and incoming traffic from external sources (such as the internet) in order to block malicious traffic like viruses and hackers. More info [[1](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(networking))][[2](https://www.dummies.com/article/technology/information-technology/networking/general-networking/network-administration-firewall-basics-184978/)].
FTP   | File Transfer Protocol. This is the protocol used for file transfers from client to server and from server to client. With a FTP application you can move/transfer files to another computer connected to the internet independent of machine type or operating systems. The FTP protocol is used in the scene for the warez servers.
IRC | Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based chat system for instant messaging. IRC is designed for group communication in discussion forums. 
NFO   | .nfo (also written .NFO or NFO, a contraction of "info", or "information") is a filename extension for text files that accompany warez scene releases of pirated software or media. NFO files contain information about the release, such as the digital media title, authorship, year, or license information.
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) |  Peer-to-Peer (P2P) is the broadest application of file distribution, P2P programs use networks of users interconnected directly through their own PCs to relay search requests and facilitate distribution of pirated software and/or content among every user on the network. P2P includes programs and networks such as: BitTorrent, DirectConnect, eDonkey, Gnutella, LimeWire, etc. 
Proxy   | A proxy server is a dedicated computer or a software system running on a computer that acts as an intermediary between an endpoint device, such as a computer, and another server from which a user or client is requesting a service.
Ripping | Ripping is the process of extracting digital content, such as audio or video files, from a physical source like a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc and converting it into a digital file format. This allows you to store, share, and play the content on various devices without the need for the original physical media.
The Scene   | The Warez scene, often referred to as The Scene, is a worldwide, underground, network of pirate groups specializing in obtaining and illegally releasing digital media for free.
Virtual Machine   | A Virtual Machine (VM) is a logically-defined approach to computing which enables the flexible use of physical architecture to service multiple functions. By sharing a pool of physical resources (such as CPU, RAM and disks) multiple “machines” can run simultaneously, increasing resource utilisation efficiency and functionality, without the need for separate computers. 
Usenet | A decentralized network of servers where users can exchange messages and files. To access Usenet, you typically need a subscription to a Usenet service provider, a newsreader software to browse and download the content, and an NZB file, which serves as a roadmap to locate and retrieve specific files within the vast network.Think of it as a fast, convenient but paid torrent.
Userscript | A script or a piece of JavaScript code that is written by users to enhance, customize, or automate the functionality of a website or web application.
VPN | A Virtual Private Network(VPN)  works by creating an encrypted connection between your device and a remote server, which then routes your online activity through that server. This process effectively hides your true IP address.VPNs are particularly useful for accessing geo-restricted content and maintaining anonymity.
VT | VT aka Virustotal is a website that provides a free online service for analyzing files and URLs to detect viruses, worms, trojans, and other kinds of malicious content.
Warez | A term used to describe pirated software, video games & music files.

### -> Movie / TV / Anime Terms 🎬 <-
-> ***Terms related to movies, tv shows, and other film piracy*** <- 
***
**Term** | **Definition**
------ | ------
Bitrate | The bitrate of a video refers to the amount of data that is processed per unit of time while playing it. The higher the bitrate, the better the quality of the movie. Pirated releases may have a lower bitrate than the original film which may result in pixelation, blurring, or compression distortions. E.g High bitrate for video would be 8-10 Mbps (megabits per second), which would be classified as an "HD" film, whereas a bitrate of 25 Mbps would be UHD or 4k. Low bit rate or "SD" files typically would be anything below 2 Mbps. 
Codec   | A ‘codec’ is a specification on how to convert from raw data to images on a screen. When a video file is stored, there is a specific codec that converts that data into what you see. The two most common codecs for movies/tv are H264, also called MPEG-4 AVC, and H265, also known as HEVC, the latter being the successor to x264.
Dubs / Dubbing | The term "dubbing" commonly refers to the replacement of the actor's voices with those of different performers speaking another language, which is called "revoicing" in the film industry. 
Fansub | A fansub is an unofficial translation of an anime, with English subtitles. A fan who subtitles anime is a fansubber. Given how this can be a lot of work, translating, typesetting, quality-checking, etc., fansubbing is typically done by several people working as a fansub group.
Hardsub | A hardsub is a subtitle that can't be toggled off. The text is edited into the video frames and the whole video has to be re-encoded, which is the video variant of adding a text to a .jpg image and saving it as .jpg again.
IPTV | IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) is a digital television broadcasting protocol that allows users to stream television content over the internet using IP networks.
Muxing | In the context of video, Muxing is the process of encapsulating multiple audio/video/subtitle tracks into a single file using a container format, like `.mkv` or `.mp4`. You can then use a video player, like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/), to choose the different tracks/subtitles you want.
OAD | Original Animation Disc (OAD) is an anime bundled as a bonus disc into a limited edition manga volume that never aired on TV or anywhere else. 
ONA | Original Net Animation (ONA) is an anime that was first made available through the internet.

Release Types   | [Index of all release formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirated_movie_release_types), [Ultimate Guide to Movie Piracy Terms](https://whereyouwatch.com/articles/ultimate-guide-to-movie-piracy-termonology/) or [Simple index of piracy releases.](https://simp6.jpg.church/images/kEOrKJTab790d9c2c497a30.png) & [Breakdown of Release types, video quality & warez release names.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/guides/video_quality_and_types_of_releases/) 
Remux   | A remux is a release that has had its contents transferred from one container format to another. The video/audio in the new container will be identical to the ones in the original file, meaning there is no loss in quality. A common example of this is an unaltered Blu-ray release, where the container file on the Disc is converted into `.mkv` or `.mp4`. So a Blu-ray Remux indicates that it's a lossless rip.
Resolution   | The amount of detail in a video or image, measured in pixels (p). Standard resolution nowadays is 1080p (also called Full HD or FHD), meaning 1920 x 1080 pixels. The most common resolutions are 480p (SD), 720p (HD), 1080p (FHD), 1440p (2K or QHD), and 2160p (4K or UHD).
Softsub | A softsub is a subtitle that can be toggled on and off. There are two types: external files (e.g. in the .srt extension) that can be loaded into a video player, and subtitle tracks embedded into the video file.
Subtitles | Subtitles are text representing the contents of the audio in a film, television show, or other audiovisual media. Subtitles might provide a transcription or translation of spoken dialogue. Although naming conventions can vary, captions are subtitles that include written descriptions of other elements of the audio like music or sound effects. [Here's a list of subtitle formats.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitles#Subtitle_formats)
Widevine | Widevine is a digital rights management (DRM) service developed by Google used to help protect online content from piracy.

### -> Music Terms 🎶 <-
-> ***Terms related to music and other forms of audio piracy*** <- 
***
**Term** | **Definition**
------ | ------
Bitrate | Bitrate refers to the amount of data used to encode digital music files. It affects the sound quality of the music, with higher bitrates generally resulting in better quality sound. When it comes to pirated music, the bitrate can vary depending on the source of the file. Lower bitrate files may result in poor quality, distortions or artifacts in the music. E.g High bitrate = 320 kilobits per second (kbps) & Low bitrate = anything below 128 kilobits (kbps).
Bootleg | Unauthorized recordings of live performances or broadcasts.
File-types   | [Index of all audio formats.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_file_format) / Audio Formats ranked : WAV, or uncompressed PCM audio > FLAC > ALAC > Atmos > Opus > AAC > MP3
LAME   | LAME Ain't An MP3 Encoder (LAME) is an encoder that converts and compresses any input audio file and outputs an MP3 file. [More info on LAME.](https://interviewfor.red/en/mp3.html)
Leak   | A music leak is an unauthorized release of music over the internet. Songs or albums may leak days or months before their scheduled release date. In other cases, the leaked material may be demos or scrapped work never intended for public release. Unreleased music is often acquired by hackers who gain unauthorized access to the e-mail or cloud storage accounts of artists, producers or record labels.
Lossless   |  Lossless formats store all of the original recorded data ( E.g WAV, FLAC, ALAC ...) There are two forms of lossless, Uncompressed (Larger files) & Compressed (Size slightly reduced).
Lossy   | A ”Lossy” file is one that has been created using a codec which discards some information from the original file during the encoding and compressing process, in an effort to reduce the output size of the file. Lossy compression attempts to strike a balance between the quality of the encoded stream and the file size. The human ear has limited resolution capability of many higher frequencies, and these are often the target of lossy codec compression, reducing the size of the file at a cost to its overall quality.
Spectral Analysis   | Spectral analysis is a visual way to display the data in a music file. [More in-depth info on Spectral Analysis.](https://interviewfor.red/en/spectrals.html)
Transcodes  | Transcoding (verb) a file means converting from one format to another. A transcode (noun) can mean any converted file, but is usually used in a negative context (as in a bad transcode). [Source with examples of transcodes.](https://interviewfor.red/en/transcodes.html)
Transparency   | Transparency is a term used to describe the audible quality of a lossy music file. A lossy file is considered transparent if the average human cannot tell the difference between the lossy file and a lossless file of the same song by just listening to both without knowing which file is which. For most people, MP3 192kbps (CBR) is considered transparent.

Examples include allowing god or "invincible" mode, providing unlimited ammunition or lives.  Many trainers are created using hacking tools and may be flagged as malicious executables by antivirus programmes. The trainer may run in parallel with the game or applied in a similar fashion to a crack.

### -> Torrenting Terms 🧲 <-
-> ***Terms related to torrenting*** <- 
***
**Term** | **Definition**
------ | ------
Availability   | The number of full copies of a file (or set of files and directories) directly available to the client. Each seed adds 1.0 to this number, as they have one complete copy of the file. A connected peer with a fraction of the file available adds that fraction to the availability, if no other peer has this part of the file.
BitTorrent   | A special kind of Peer-to-Peer system. It uses a central location which coodinates the downloads but it doesn't host any downloads. The download itself consists of several pieces offered by various users.
Connectability | Connectability relates to the state of “being connectable”. Being connectable means that an incoming port on your computer is open thereby allowing “other peers in the Bit Torrent swarm to be able to make connections to you” (that is to say, “people in the same torrent as you can contact you in order to share data.”). A connectable user can share data with anyone in the torrent whereas a unconnectable user is restricted to sharing data only with peers who are connectable, being unconnectable also negatively affects the speed of the “swarm”.
Freeleech   | Freeleech means that the download size of the torrent does not count towards your overall ratio, only the uploaded amount on the torrent counts toward your ratio.
Hash   | The hash is a digital fingerprint in the form of a string of alphanumeric characters (typically hexadecimal) in the .torrent file that the client uses to verify the integrity of data that is being transferred. "Hash" is the shorter form of the word "hashsum". Torrent files contain information such as the URL of the torrent's tracker, a list of files contained within a torrent, their size, format and relevant attributes. The torrent client will check each "piece" of the torrent against the hash. If it fails verification, the data is discarded and requested again.
Hit-and-run(HnR)  | To intentionally "leech" a file; downloading a file while seeding as little as possible.
IP Address | An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves as a way to identify and locate devices on a network, allowing them to communicate with each other and with other networks. IP addresses can be dynamic or static, meaning they can change or remain the same over time.
Leech / Leeching   | Leech has two meanings. Often, leecher is synonymous with downloader: simply describing a peer or any client that does not have 100% of the data. The term leech also refers to a peer (or peers) that has a negative effect on the swarm by having a very poor share ratio, downloading much more than they upload.
Magnet   | A type of hyperlink that enables the downloading of files and data from P2P sharing networks, particularly torrent networks.
Peer   | A peer is one instance of a BitTorrent client running on a computer on the Internet to which other clients connect and transfer data. Depending on context, "peer" can refer either to any client in the swarm or more specifically to a downloader, a client that has only parts of the file.
Port Forwarding | Port forwarding, sometimes called port mapping, allows computers or services in private networks to connect over the internet with other public or private computers or services. [Video Explaining Port Forwaring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G1ueMDgwxw) or [Beginners Guide to Port Forwarding.](https://learn.g2.com/port-forwarding)  
Private Tracker | A private tracker is a BitTorrent tracker that restricts use by requiring users to register with the site. The method for controlling registration used among many private trackers is an invitation system, in which active and contributing members are given the ability to grant a new user permission to register at the site, or a new user goes through an interview process.
 Public Tracker | Public or open trackers can be used by anyone by adding the tracker address to an existing torrent, or they can be used by any newly created torrent.
Ratio   | Ratio or Share Ratio is a number determined by dividing the amount of data that user has uploaded by the amount of data they have downloaded. Final share ratios over 1.0 carry a positive connotation in the BitTorrent community, because they indicate that the user has sent more data to other users than they received. Likewise, share ratios under 1 have negative connotation.
Seed / Seeding  | A seed refers to a machine possessing all of the data (100% completion). A peer or downloader becomes a seed when it completely downloads all the data and continues/starts uploading data for other peers to download from. Seeding is the uploading of already downloaded content for others to download from.
Seedbox | A Seedbox is a server box that is rented each month to download and seed torrent files. Seedboxes are generally used for the uploading and downloading of digital files generally making use of the BitTorrent protocol though they can also be used on other file sharing websites.
Super-Seeding   | Super-Seeding (aka 'Initial Seeding') is an algorithm for the BitTorrent communications protocol that helps downloaders become uploaders more quickly, but it introduces the danger of total seeding failure if there is only one downloader.
Swarm   | All peers (including seeds) sharing the same content are called a swarm.
Torrent   | A torrent file or meta-info file is a computer file that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed, and usually also a list of the network locations of trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system find each other and form efficient distribution groups called swarms.
Tracker   | A BitTorrent tracker is a special type of server that assists in the communication between peers using the BitTorrent protocol. The "tracker" server keeps track of where file copies reside on peer machines, which ones are available at time of the client request, and helps coordinate efficient transmission and reassembly of the copied file.
