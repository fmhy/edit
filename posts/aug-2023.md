**Wiki Updates**
  
* Moved fmhy.ml to **[fmhy.net](https://fmhy.net/)**, and updated its UI to more closely match [fmhy.pages.dev](https://fmhy.pages.dev/).
  
* Separated Android Tools into subcategories: [Device](https://fmhy.pages.dev/android-iosguide/#android-device), [Utilities](https://fmhy.pages.dev/android-iosguide/#android-utilities), [Internet](https://fmhy.pages.dev/android-iosguide/#android-internet), [Camera](https://fmhy.pages.dev/android-iosguide/#android-camera) and [Customization](https://fmhy.pages.dev/android-iosguide/#customization).

* Added a [Engineering](https://fmhy.pages.dev/edupiracyguide/#engineering) section to Educational. 

* Renamed Multi Hosts to [Multi Server](https://fmhy.pages.dev/videopiracyguide/#multi-server), Dedicated Hosts to [Single Server](https://fmhy.pages.dev/videopiracyguide/#single-server), and bumped Multi above Single as they're generally better. 

* Moved all the APK sections out of storage, and back into the main [Android section](https://fmhy.pages.dev/android-iosguide/#android-apks).

* Combined all [Indian Language sites](https://fmhy.pages.dev/non-english/#indian-languages) into one section in Non-Eng, as most host content for more than one language.

**Things Removed**

* Removed Bromite as they've [stopped updates](https://i.imgur.com/uM3ryHR.png), and replaced it with [Cromite](https://github.com/uazo/cromite) which will continue to be updated by one of their devs.

* Removed AI Text Detectors as they're known for [being inaccurate](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/openai-discontinues-its-ai-writing-detector-due-to-low-rate-of-accuracy/).

* Unstarred SoftArchive in Software as people have become annoyed with their slow hosts.
 
* Unstarred LookMovie in Streaming as people don't like the fact 1080p is behind premium. 

* Unstarred QuickBoost in Tweaking as the app doesn't give details as to what each tweak actually does.

* Unstarred Sockshare in Streaming as their original domain died, and it doesn't have the best UI anyways.

* Removed AnimeKaizoku from Anime Streaming as they've shutdown.

* Removed DeepFloyd from Image Generators as its been paused for over a month.

* Removed Appnee from Software Sites. The MAS team found that they host many [unsafe activators](https://i.imgur.com/KmDKUw4.png). We don't think Appnee is purposefully malicious, they just need to be more careful and clean things up before we can add them again.
