**Things Removed**

* We've stopped accepting and started removing all AI tools that require paid API keys to function.

* Removed FileCR as they've been [caught with malware](https://rentry.co/filecr_malware), and still haven't removed it. 

* Removed AnonFiles as they've decided to quit due to people [abusing the site](https://i.imgur.com/lXoEqAV.png).

* Unstarred WinRar in File Archivers. People feel its not as useful anymore given open-source options like 7-Zip / NanaZip.

* Removed RVX from ReVanced section as its been [discontinued](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-documentation/wiki/Announcement).

* Removed PDF Drive in PDF Sites as downloads no longer work. 

* Removed TronScript in Debloaters. Some people consider it [overkill](https://i.imgur.com/K5hf5Bu.png). 

* Removed Poe in AI Chatbots as its now limited to 10 daily messages (or 100 in some countries.)

* Removed the "Everything I Know" wiki from Indexes as they've gone [paid](https://i.imgur.com/ig8jPGL.jpg). You can get around it by blocking the overlay, but we're not interested in sending traffic their way anymore.

* Unstarred 1337x and added [warning](https://pastebin.com/Rc9MYMZ7) to avoid software / games, as they've had issues with malware, including a torrent that was up for days after being reported. They did remove it eventually, and [respond](https://i.imgur.com/ij4CXIm.png) to the situation, so we feel it would be unfair to remove their site entirely. Our hope is that 1337x acts quicker in the future, avoids situations like this, and begins to earn trust back from people over time.
