## Submitting a Link

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't tested the link you'd like to submit, especially if it's a DDL site, please open an **[Issue](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/issues)** or reach out to us on **[Discord](https://rentry.co/fmhy-invite)** rather than making a Pull Request.

1. Before submitting a link, please **[search](https://redd.it/105xraz)** to make sure it's not already in the wiki.

2. The order of priority is: **Site > Git Repository > Store Link**
Please only use the store link if there's neither a site nor a Git repository available for the app/extension you'd like to submit.

3. Always check to see if the site you'd like to submit has a Discord / Telegram server you can link with it.

4. Find a suitable category for the link and then submit it by making a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pulls)**.

## Reporting a Site

> [!TIP]
> If you want to make bigger changes to the wiki, such as debloating or restructuring a page/section, please discuss those changes with us via **[Discord](https://rentry.co/fmhy-invite)** before making a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pulls)**.

You can do one of the following:

- Open an **[Issue](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/issues)** or a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pulls)** and don't forget to explain why you think the site(s) in question should be removed, unstarred, and/or changed.

- Alternatively, you can reach out to us on **[Discord](https://rentry.co/fmhy-invite)** if you're unsure whether the site should be reported or if you'd like to discuss your report with more people.
