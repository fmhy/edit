- The filename should be in the format `month-year.md`.
- The description should be a short, descriptive description of the post.
- Authors should be in the format `['username', ....]`
- The ending shouldn't have a line break (`---`/`***`).
- Links to the website should be turned into relative links, i.e. `[Text Tools](https://fmhy.net/text-tools)` -> `[Text Tools](/text-tools)`.
