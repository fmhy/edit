### Adblocking

> How important is using an adblocker?

Piracy sites usually contain ads, some of which can be harmful, often leading to unwanted pages or fake download buttons. Real download buttons are usually small, and match the sites design, while fake ones are often big and eye-catching. It can be hard to tell them apart, so its important to always have an adblocker.

For browsers we recommend **[uBO](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation)**, and you can also use a **[Redirect Skipper](https://fmhy.net/adblockvpnguide#redirect-bypass)** to skip annoying countdowns. 

For mobile **[AdGuard Premium](https://rentry.co/FMHYBase64#adguard-premium)** / [iOS](https://rentry.co/FMHYBase64#adguard-pro-ios) or **[Rethink DNS](https://rethinkdns.com/app)**, and you can block YouTube, Reddit, and Twitter ads with **[ReVanced Manager](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager)** / [Easy Setup](https://rentry.co/revanced-auto-update).

!!!note Using several ad blockers, like uBO and Adblock Plus at the same time can [mess things up](https://twitter.com/gorhill/status/1033706103782170625). This only happens with regular ad blockers, so it’s perfectly okay to use uBO alongside something like SponsorBlock.

### Browsers

> Which web browser should I use?

We recommend  **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)**, but you can also try **[Privacy-Focused Browsers](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/adblock-vpn-privacy/#wiki_.25B7_browser_privacy)**, or **[Brave](https://brave.com/)** if you prefer Chromium-based. 

For mobile we recommend **[Cromite](https://github.com/uazo/cromite)**, **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/android/)** or **[Mull](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/mull-fenix)** for privacy.

!!!note Its highly recommended to look through our [Extension](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/internet-tools#wiki_.25B7_browser_extensions) / [Userscript](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/internet-tools#wiki_.25B7_userscripts) pages to find ways to enhance your browser.

### Antivirus

> How can I safely scan files, and determine if detection's are false positives?

Before installing any file, its recommended to scan the setup / install with **[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)**. If you're having trouble determining if something is a false positive, refer to the **[Scan Guide](https://rentry.co/VTGuide)**, or send it to us in Discord and we'll take a look for you.

!!!note Most antivirus programs are unnecessary and can cause slow down. If you use trusted websites, Windows Defender should be all you need to stay safe, and you can run a [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) scan from time to time for extra protection.

***

### Privacy 

> I don't have anything to hide, why should I care about privacy?

Privacy is about controlling your personal information, not just keeping things secret. Non-sensitive data is used by companies to track your behavior, target ads, and influence your choices. 

For email privacy, we recommend **[Proton](https://proton.me/mail)** and for search **[SearX](https://searx.nixnet.services/)**. It's also good to check sites like **[HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)** to make sure your info hasn't been part of any recent data breaches.

!!!note Its best *not* to use your main email or password when you sign up for piracy sites. Its good to use a different password on every site you register for, that way if a breach happens, only the password for that one site is compromised.

***

### Windows Piracy

> How can I download / activate Windows for free?

Download an ISO from Massgrave's **[Genuine Installation Media](https://massgrave.dev/genuine-installation-media)** page, and follow the **[Clean Install Windows Guide](https://gravesoft.dev/clean_install_windows)** to install it. After install, activate it with **[Microsoft Activation Scripts](https://massgrave.dev/#Method-1---PowerShell)**.

* **Software Piracy: [CRACKSurl](https://cracksurl.com/) / [LRepacks](https://lrepacks.net/)**
* **Adobe Piracy: [M0nkrus](https://w14.monkrus.ws/) / [GenP](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenP/wiki/redditgenpguides/)**

!!!note Be aware that people have been known to steal from M0nkrus and upload altered versions of their apps that contain harmful elements. Always double-check that you're on the official site before downloading anything.

***

### Torrenting

> Do I need a VPN to torrent?

Downloading files through torrenting can cause issues with your ISP, so using a **[VPN](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/adblock-vpn-privacy#wiki_.25BA_vpn)** is a must in most countries. VPNs have a kill switch feature that stops data from leaking, but you should also **[bind your VPN](https://redd.it/ssy8vv)** to your torrent client. You can also use **[Remote Torrenting Services](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/torrent#wiki_.25B7_remote_torrenting)** to avoid the need for VPN altogether.

* **Torrent Clients: [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) / [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) / [Deluge](https://www.deluge-torrent.org/)**
* **Torrent Sites:  [TorrentGalaxy](https://torrentgalaxy.to/) / [RuTracker](https://rutracker.org/)**
