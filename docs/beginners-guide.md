### Adblocking

> How important is using an adblocker?

Sites generally contain ads, some of which can be harmful, often leading to unwanted pages or fake download buttons. Real download buttons are usually small, often text-based or subtly integrated into the site's design. Fake ones are frequently large, brightly coloured, use generic terms like 'Download Now', and may appear multiple times on a page. It can be hard to tell them apart, so it's important to always have an adblocker.

For browsers we recommend **[uBO](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)**, and you can also use a **[Redirect Skipper](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/internet-tools/#wiki_.25B7_redirect_bypass)** to skip annoying countdowns.

For mobile **[AdGuard Premium](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/android/#wiki_.25B7_android_adblocking)** / [iOS](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-ios/overview.html) / [Guide](https://ios.cfw.guide/sideloading-apps/) or **[Rethink DNS](https://rethinkdns.com/app)**, and you can block YouTube, Reddit, and X.com ads with **[ReVanced Manager](https://revanced.app/)** / [Easy Setup](https://wispydocs.pages.dev/revanced-obtainium/). Note that uBO works on mobile browsers like Firefox / Brave too.

!!!note Using several ad blockers, like uBO and AdGuard at the same time can [mess things up](https://x.com/gorhill/status/1033706103782170625). This only happens with regular ad blockers, so it's perfectly okay to use uBO alongside something like SponsorBlock.

### Antivirus

> How can I safely scan files, and determine if detections are false positives?

Before installing any file, it's recommended to scan the setup / install with **[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)**. If you're having trouble determining if something is a false positive, refer to the **[Scan Guide](https://claraiscute.neocities.org/Guides/vtguide)** / [2](https://claraiscute.pages.dev/Guides/vtguide), or send it to us in Discord and we'll take a look for you. For Android Apps, its best to analyze them in a sandbox like [Triage](https://tria.ge/).

!!!note Most antivirus programs are unnecessary and can cause slow down. If you use trusted websites, Windows Defender should be all you need to stay safe, and you can run a [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) scan from time to time for extra protection.

### Browsers

> Which web browser should I use?

We recommend **[Firefox](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/internet-tools/#wiki_.25B7_firefox_tools)**, but you can also try **[Privacy-Focused Browsers](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/adblock-vpn-privacy/#wiki_.25B7_browser_privacy)** or **[Brave](https://brave.com/)** if you prefer Chromium.

For Android, we recommend **[Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/browsers/mobile/android/)**, **[Brave](https://brave.com/)** or **[Cromite](https://github.com/uazo/cromite)**.

For iOS, we recommend **[Orion](https://kagi.com/orion/)**, **[Brave](https://brave.com/)** or **Safari + [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-ios/overview.html)**.

!!!note We recommend looking through our [Extension](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/internet-tools#wiki_.25B7_browser_extensions) / [Userscript](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/internet-tools#wiki_.25B7_userscripts) sections to find ways to enhance your browser.

### Base64

### Privacy

> I don't have anything to hide, why should I care about privacy?

Privacy is about controlling your personal information, not just keeping things secret. Non-sensitive data is used by companies to track your behavior, target ads, and influence your choices.

For email privacy, we recommend **[Proton](https://proton.me/mail)** and for search **[SearX](https://searx.fmhy.net/)**. It's also good to check sites like **[HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)** to make sure your info hasn't been part of any recent data breaches.

!!!note Remember never to use your real email, or password on any site you're not sure is trustworthy. It's good to use a different password on every site you register for, that way if a breach happens, only the password for that one site is compromised. You can also use email [aliasing](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/internet-tools/#wiki_.25B7_email_aliasing).

!!!note Keep in mind that it's **never** a good idea to upload personal or confidential files to any file host / cloud AI, even if they claim to be encrypted.

### Windows Guide

> How can I download / activate Windows for free?

Download an ISO from Massgrave's **[Genuine Installation Media](https://massgrave.dev/genuine-installation-media)** page, and follow the **[Clean Install Windows Guide](https://massgrave.dev/clean_install_windows)** to install it. After install, activate it with **[Microsoft Activation Scripts](https://rentry.co/FMHYB64#mas)**. If you'd like to use Windows 10 past its End-Of-Life date, follow **[Windows 10 After EOL](https://massgrave.dev/windows10_eol)**.

* **[Windows Install / Debloat Guide](https://wispydocs.pages.dev/windows/)**
* **Software Sites: [Virgil Software Search](https://virgil.samidy.com/Software/) / [CracksURL](https://cracksurl.com/) / [LRepacks](https://lrepacks.net/)**

!!!note Be aware that unofficial sources often re-upload M0nkrus's repacks, sometimes with added malware. Always verify you are downloading from M0nkrus's actual site, which we link on FMHY before downloading anything. Do not trust search engine results blindly for such specific repackers.

### Torrenting

> Do I need a VPN to torrent?

Downloading files through torrenting can cause issues with your ISP, so using a **[VPN](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/adblock-vpn-privacy#wiki_.25BA_vpn)** is a must in most countries. You should also **[bind your VPN](https://wispydocs.pages.dev/torrenting/)** to your torrent client. This ensures that if your VPN connection drops, your torrent client stops all traffic, preventing your real IP address from being exposed. You can also use **[Remote Torrenting Services](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/torrent#wiki_.25B7_remote_torrenting)** to avoid the need for a VPN altogether.

> What is Port Forwarding? Do I need it?

[Port forwarding](https://wispydocs.pages.dev/torrenting/#port-forwarding) (having an open port) is an essential part of torrenting and it's recommended to set it up. While it's not strictly needed, it benefits the swarm, can sometimes boost download speeds, and improves connectability for torrents with fewer seeds.
