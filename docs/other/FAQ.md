# FAQ

**Q:** Why are there no posts? Is the subreddit dead? :( 

**A:** Posting has always been off to keep the chances of the sub surviving as high as possible. Our main focus is the [**Wiki**](https://fmhy.net), which has grown to include nearly 30k links. It's 100% alive, and gets updated [daily](https://github.com/nbats/FMHYedit/commits/main). For a discussion sub, check out [r/Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy).
