## Tournament Results

We did another streaming sites tournament to help us better re-order and clean
up the section. When we did this publicly the first time there was obvious
cheating, so we decided to make this more private, and allowed only members with
discord roles to vote. During each round we also had discussions about the sites
which can be viewed in our discord polls channel. These discussions were taken
into account when reordering, but for the most part we relied on the voting
results.

In the end some sites managed to keep their previous spots, a few have been
starred, unstarred, or even removed if they were low quality / broken. If you
see a round with no votes either way, it means one of the sites was DQ'd.

We'll be doing more tournaments in the future, so make sure to join our discord
if you want to be a part of them, and let us know which sections you'd like to
see most.
