# Wiki Updates

- Added **[Alternative Frontend](https://ffmhy.pages.dev/)** of FMHY with a totally different design. This pulls from the official source, so it will stay synced with new edits. It also has a [random site](https://i.ibb.co/fVkHqhRP/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/p4Mxs8y.png) button that works per page. Note the front page for this has been removed, and it now directs to the wiki itself. Thank you to nw for making this.

- Added **[3 New Instances](https://fmhy.net/other/backups)** to our Backups Page (Samidy, JBugel, ArtistGrid).

- Added **[Catppuccin](https://i.ibb.co/Ps8vDJL0/image.png)** / [2](https://i.imgur.com/558l4gH.png) as an option in our color picker. Thank you to Samidy for doing this.

- Added a new section for [Textbooks](https://fmhy.net/reading#textbooks).

- Added a new section for [File Info / Metadata](https://fmhy.net/file-tools#file-info-metadata).

- Merged Linux + Mac Torrent Clients into the [Main Section](https://fmhy.net/torrenting#torrent-clients), and added labels + platform icons. [Before vs. After](https://i.ibb.co/fV1zdt44/Untitled.jpg) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/THLiMqL.jpeg)

- Re-ordered [Light Novel Sites](https://fmhy.net/reading#light-novels) based on library size and UI, added labels, removed small libraries, and starred two that stood out (NovelCool + WuxiaClick). [Before vs. After](https://i.ibb.co/DSRfsrM/Untitled.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/IMRUQoo.png)

- Debloated the [Audio Recommendation](https://fmhy.net/audio#curated-recommendations) section + added a new section for [Song / Artist Discovery](https://fmhy.net/audio#song-artist-discovery). [Before vs. After](https://i.ibb.co/zTDNZgr9/Untitled.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/V6h0mQx.png)

- Added Labels to both [Linux Cheat Sheets](https://fmhy.net/linux-macos#cli-cheat-sheets) + [Linux Distros](https://fmhy.net/linux-macos#linux-distros). Thank you to [helxop](https://github.com/fmhy/edit/commit/9a9cd6dd47027ac63370b453ec86a943cdc0b9d6). [Before vs. After](https://ibb.co/gMD8mKbw) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/hqqLsCB.png)

- Revamped our [Feedback Window](https://i.ibb.co/JjpzRXL7/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/nODLPVM.png) to try to improve its look. Thank you to Samidy for doing this.

- Added a backup / frontend for our [Grading Page](https://fmhy-grading.pages.dev/), and moved both our [Backup](https://fmhy.net/other/backups) + [FAQ](https://fmhy.net/other/FAQ) pages to our website instead of Reddit/GitHub. Thank you to Roi Goat + Samidy for doing this.

- Improved our [theme handler](https://github.com/fmhy/edit/pull/4386), which will help us more easily switch or add themes in the future (like Halloween, Christmas, etc.). Thank you to Land for doing this.

- Added 360 Total Security to unsafe sites. If you install any of their apps, it will keep giving the user popups to install their "toolbox," or will install it without consent if you use clean, repair, or optimize options. Once installed, the toolbox will then [modify your default apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Qihoo_360#Malicious_promotion) (such as your browser) and switch them all to 360 options.

# Things Removed

- Removed CrocDB as they've been [hit by DMCA](https://i.ibb.co/RpDvJFgf/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/iSV0MHq.png). 

- Removed the IcebergCharts website as they've been [hacked a few times now](https://i.ibb.co/XxMMwqDk/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/MkvElvr.png), and can't figure out why it's happening. We may re-add it in the future if they figure it out. Note that we'll keep the subreddit in its place for now.

- Removed CanvasBlocker as it's Firefox-only, and FF has this built-in now; it can also apparently make fingerprinting worse in some cases and isn't maintained well anymore.

- Removed FTV and WAC from Live Sports as both are now gone.

- Removed Foxified as it's suddenly [filling results with ads](https://i.ibb.co/4RzPsQ8Z/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/AjBMdfX.png). 

- Unstarred OnTheSpot as it will be losing Spotify support soon.

- Unstarred Windsurf in Coding AIs as its limits and free models aren't as good anymore.
