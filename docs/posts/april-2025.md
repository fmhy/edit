- Replaced star for xManager with [ReVanced Manager](https://fmhy.net/android-iosguide#android-audio) in Ad-Free Spotify as it has more features, less issues, and xManager itself recommends it.

- Removed star for bark as its limited, and star for Tortoise TTS as it doesn't sound good, and instead starred [TTS Online](https://fmhy.net/ai#text-to-speech), which sounds better and has a 10k daily character limit.
