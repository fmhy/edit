# Things Removed

- Unstarred G-MEH as it tends to have outdated plugins, disabled pages, and people feel there are better options.

- Unstarred SystemRequirementsLab as people don't feel it's very useful anymore.

- Unstarred Comfy Online as it has older / more limited models than other starred options.

- Removed Awesome Piracy as it's no longer maintained very well. No disrespect intended - Awesome Piracy is older than FMHY and inspired us in a lot of ways early on; if it starts getting maintained better, we'll consider re-adding it.
