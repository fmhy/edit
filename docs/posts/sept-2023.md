### Things Removed

- We've stopped accepting and started removing all AI tools that require paid
  API keys to function.

- Removed FileCR as they've been
  [caught with malware](https://rentry.co/filecr_malware) and still haven't
  removed it.

- Removed AnonFiles as they've decided to quit due to people
  [abusing the site](https://i.imgur.com/lXoEqAV.png).

- Unstarred WinRAR in File Archivers. People feel it's not as useful anymore
  given open-source options like 7-Zip / NanaZip.

- Removed RVX from the ReVanced section as it's been
  [discontinued](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-documentation/wiki/Announcement).

- Removed PDF Drive in PDF Sites as downloads no longer work.

- Removed TronScript in Debloaters. Some people consider it
  [overkill](https://i.imgur.com/K5hf5Bu.png).

- Removed Poe in AI Chatbots as it's now limited to 10 daily messages (or 100 in
  some countries).

- Removed the "Everything I Know" wiki from Indexes as they've gone
  [paid](https://i.imgur.com/ig8jPGL.jpg). You can get around it by blocking the
  overlay, but we're not interested in sending traffic their way anymore.

- Unstarred 1337x and added a [warning](https://pastebin.com/Rc9MYMZ7) to avoid
  software / games, as they've had issues with malware, including a torrent that
  was up for days after being reported. They did remove it eventually and
  [responded](https://i.imgur.com/ij4CXIm.png) to the situation, so we feel it
  would be unfair to remove their site entirely. Our hope is that 1337x acts
  quicker in the future, avoids situations like this, and begins to earn trust
  back from people over time.
