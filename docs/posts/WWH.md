People always want to know what the point of life is. Why are they on earth? What are we doing here? Whats our purpose? *Whats the point?* 

For most of my life, I didn't really have any answer, but as I got older, I realized, things weren't about me. I took a step back, and recognized a much bigger picture we're all apart of, and I now know exactly why we're here on earth. 

As a human, you have a powerful ability, to calm, heal, and help those around you. You have the ability to protect both the people in our world, and the planet itself from harm and distress.  

I know there is a huge amount of pain in our world, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness, and believe me when I say, I share the same feelings. However I believe its important that we each learn to ***harness that energy into things that are positive and kind***, not negative or evil. 

Remember that a lot of who you are, is your ability to experience things outside of yourself, *including other humans.* They are a direct and immediate part of your own reality. Treat their struggles and woes as if they were your own, don't leave people behind, don't leave people unloved. As frustrating as the world can be, it is worth protecting, it is worth loving, it is worth healing together.

* *"Life is a beautiful, magnificent thing, even to a jellyfish... The trouble is you won't fight. You've given in, continually dwelling on sickness and death. But there's something just as inevitable as death, and that's life. Life, life, life. Think of all the power that's in the universe, moving the earth, growing the trees. That's the same power within you if you only have the courage and the will to use it."* - Charlie Chaplin, Limelight 1952

* *"The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone."* - Isa Upanishad
