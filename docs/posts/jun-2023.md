### Things Removed

- Removed and unstarred RARBG as they have decided to
  [call it quits](https://ibb.co/zxcLTpq).

- Unstarred Mullvad in VPNs as they are
  [removing support for port forwarding](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2023/5/29/removing-the-support-for-forwarded-ports/).

- Unstarred Patoghu in Download Sites. They've added
  [Persian CAPTCHAs](https://ibb.co/2SjzZb1) to their downloads, making the site
  useless to English users.

- Unstarred MagicBrush in AI Image Generators. Not quite as good as other free
  options now.

- Unstarred Authy in Privacy Tools as it's not open-source.

- Unstarred Awesome ChatGPT as it's no longer updated.

- Bromite doesn't seem to be maintained anymore, so we've replaced the main repo
  with an [auto-build](/mobile/) for now.
