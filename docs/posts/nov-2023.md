### Things Removed

- Removed CrackHub as they've sadly decided to
  [call it quits](https://i.imgur.com/jaY0grY.png). Huge thank you to them for
  providing such a solid site, and so many games to people for as long as they
  did. They will be missed.

- Unstarred PromptJungle in Online Image Generators as their bot is broken and
  Discord channels have been locked. Apparently they're going to make a
  comeback, but its been over a month now.

- Unstarred C1NE in Streaming Sites. It used to be good, but for whatever reason
  its extremely slow now.

- Unstarred Photopea as they caused a bunch of drama in the privacy community by
  [suddenly changing their ad policy](https://yev.varyel.com/post/732023637981446144/psa-photopea-just-became-a-very-shady-option-for),
  and adding an anti-adblock detector to their site. I believe they've removed
  it, but a lot of people have lost trust in them now.

- Removed Privacy Pass from extensions as it no longer works.
