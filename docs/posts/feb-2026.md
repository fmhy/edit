# Wiki Updates

- Our site's default search is now **[Exact Match](https://i.ibb.co/rKNb8CGh/34t34g34.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/6XUs4fs.png)**, which is a lot more accurate. You can toggle between both exact and fuzzy. TY to Zenith for doing this.

- Added **[Note Tooltips](https://i.ibb.co/mCZJzj1N/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/acbozgK.png)** that can be viewed simply by hovering over them. TY to Bread for doing this.

- Added an [Index Toggle](https://i.ibb.co/zVhQJDGt/234234234.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/oYXk3vw.png) to view only the indexes on a page, similar to the star toggle. TY to Zenith.
