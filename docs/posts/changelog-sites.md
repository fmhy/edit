Note that we will also continue to make the monthly posts same as always, and you can still follow updates by joining our [Discord](https://redd.it/17f8msf), or watching the [Commits Page](https://github.com/fmhy/edit/commits/main/) on GitHub yourself.

We hope you guys like them, if you have any suggestions or questions feel free to let us know.
