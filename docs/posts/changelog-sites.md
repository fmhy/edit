Hey everyone, as you guys know we make a lot of changes to FMHY, but the current ways to track those changes are pretty limited. The only real options are joining Discord, or watching markdown commits on GitHub, neither of which is ideal for everyone.

To help make things easier, the following two changelog sites have been built. 

***

**https://changes.fmhy.bid/**

This covers changes that occur in both the #Recently-Added and #Monthly-Update channels in our Discord.

***

**https://fmhy-tracker.pages.dev/**

This covers links that have been added, updated, or removed by watching GitHub for changes.

***

Note that we will also continue to make the monthly posts same as always, and you can still follow updates by joining our [Discord](https://redd.it/17f8msf), or watching the [Commits Page](https://github.com/fmhy/edit/commits/main/) on GitHub yourself.

We hope you guys like them, if you have any suggestions or questions feel free to let us know.
