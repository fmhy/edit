### Wiki Updates

- Our official pastebin, **[snowbin](https://pastes.fmhy.net/)** is now live!
  Keep in mind pastes only last for 7 days, and as of now you can't make edits,
  but we may add features like this in the future.

- Ran a [poll](https://i.imgur.com/73paJlr.png) regarding streaming sites, and
  used the results to help us re-order the
  [streaming section.](/videopiracyguide)

- Turned Spotify into its own section w/ subsections:
  [Clients](/audiopiracyguide#spotify-clients),
  [Adblockers](/audiopiracyguide#spotify-adblockers),
  [Download](/audiopiracyguide#spotify-download) and
  [Tools](/audiopiracyguide#spotify-tools).

- Added a section for [Soundtracks](/audiopiracyguide#media-soundtracks) in
  Audio.

- Added sections for [Computer Science](/devtools#computer-science) and
  [Docker](/devtools#docker-tools) in Dev Tools.

- Added a section for
  [Two-Factor Authentication](/adblockvpnguide#two-factor-authentication) in Web
  Privacy.

- Re-organized [Magazine Sites](/readingpiracyguide#magazines) + added filehosts
  to their descriptions.

- Removed OnStream from unsafe sites. The ["evidence"](https://rentry.co/upo2r)
  we had listed wasn't very solid. If someone has more proof we can re-consider,
  but for now we don't have reason enough to call them unsafe. Keep in mind its
  not posted in the wiki, just removed from our unsafe list.

- We recently moved off Netlify, and soon after a scammer
  [took over the domain](https://i.imgur.com/rByoHnf.png). If you had this page
  bookmarked we'd highly recommend you remove it, and update to our
  [new domain](/). We've tried reporting it to Netlify, but so far they haven't
  done anything.

- Grammar issues have been fixed
  [throughout the wiki](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pull/1337) /
  [2](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pull/1340) /
  [3](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pull/1339). Remember that anyone can send
  [pull requests](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit) to our github so don't be
  afraid to help us fix things like this.

- Added a mirror of our site to [github.io](https://fmhy.github.io/FMHYedit/).
