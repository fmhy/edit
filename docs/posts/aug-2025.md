- Cleaned up formatting in [Adblock section](https://fmhy.net/privacy#adblocking). [Before vs. After](https://i.ibb.co/0jcysGV3/Adblock-Before.png)

- Decided to bring back our [Saidit backup](https://saidit.net/s/freemediaheckyeah/wiki/index). Saidit has always supported us; their owner actually posted FMHY themselves on the main Saidit wiki. It's always good to have places like this that we know we can trust.

- To make streaming easier to navigate, we've separated [API Frontends](https://fmhy.net/video#api-frontends) and [Single Server](https://fmhy.net/video#single-server) sites into their own sections. 

- Thank you to Hugo, Samidy, Dan, kick, Anarchydr, and everyone else who helped re-organize or create the sections this month.

# Things Removed

- Removed nsw2u, nswdl, ps4pkg, and game-2u as they've been targeted and [shut down](https://torrentfreak.com/fbi-seizes-gaming-piracy-domains-including-pre-release-target-nsw2u/) by the FBI.

- Removed InstallGentoo Wiki as it's been taken over by trolls. As of now the site should be avoided (NSFL content), but we'll consider re-adding if the situation ever gets handled.

- Removed HuggingChat as it's [shut down](https://x.com/julien_c/status/1940082259287069089). Note that HuggingFace still works; it's only chat that's gone.

- Removed Cobalt from YT downloaders as it [no longer supports YouTube](https://x.com/justusecobalt/status/1943279590178230618). Note that it still supports other video sites, so we've kept it in other sections it fits in.

- Removed Masquerade Repacks as they've [called it quits](https://i.ibb.co/0pndbGNP/image.png); note that Kaos itself is still going strong.
