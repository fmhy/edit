- Updated [grading criteria #4 and #5](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHY/wiki/Stream-Site-Grading) to reward sites that have source auto-switch + episode auto-next working across all their servers. Also merged quality, subtitle, and media type criteria into #1 to simplify scoring, and started giving points for watch party support. This has reduced the total amount of stars and helped the best sites stand out more. [Before vs. After](https://i.imgur.com/omYr1pQ.png).
