- Removed free WARP keys as they're being revoked now.

- Removed DramaCool as they're [shutting down](https://x.com/dramacoolcom/status/1861628424147869919). We're aware GogoAnime has also stopped updates, but we're waiting for more news before removing them.

- Removed both SusFlix and BFlix as they've been offline for over a week.

- Unstarred multiple streaming sites as we had so many stars they became meaningless. [Before vs. After](https://i.ibb.co/QPxKLm2/image.png).

- Unstarred Claude as the free tier is too limited now.

- Unstarred ClearURLs as it's mostly redundant with adblockers like uBO.
