### Wiki Updates

  from FMHY. You can also download the guides yourself by using this

- Made a [Pokémon](/gaming/#pok%C3%A9mon-tools) section in Gaming
  Tools and an [Email](/internet-tools#email-tools) section in Internet Tools.

- Added [emojis](https://i.imgur.com/mgYq8nF.png) to indicate when we're linking
  3rd party indexes or our storage page:

🌐 = 3rd Party Indexes (i.e., /r/PiratedGames Mega, Awesome Lists, etc.)
