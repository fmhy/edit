# Wiki Updates

- Added the **[Amoled Theme](https://i.ibb.co/hx97zL3W/978676.jpg)** / [2](https://i.imgur.com/fMrnGmF.png) to our site as a [Toggle](https://i.ibb.co/pvkfg3hC/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/qF7exKw.png) that can be turned on or off. Thank you to @Land for doing this.

- Built a **[External Search Engine](https://fmhy-search.dev.zenir.tech/)** that should work better in most cases than the built in VitePress search on our website.

- Added a **[New Backup](https://fmhyclone.pages.dev/)** of FMHY with daily sync, hosted on GitLab. It also has a backup of the [raw markdown](https://fmhyapi.wispy.qzz.io/single-page) page. We also added another [backup](https://a-fmhy.pages.dev/) of our website that has the theme on from above on automatically.

- The Space section has become a bit hard to navigate (60+ lines,) so we've split it into its [own head section](https://fmhy.net/educational#space), with 2 new subsections: [Astronomy](https://fmhy.net/educational#astronomy) and [Spacecraft](https://fmhy.net/educational#spacecraft). Astronomy will cover things related to celestial objects or phenomena in the cosmos. Spacecraft will cover things like rockets, launches and the ISS. The head section will be for more general space related things, like NASAs website, news, etc.

- Remakes / Ports in gaming had over 80 lines, and was pretty disorganized, so we've split it into 3 new sections to make it more comprehensible: [Decomps / Ports](https://fmhy.net/gaming#decomps-ports), [Remakes / Recreations](https://fmhy.net/gaming#remakes-recreations) and [Revival Projects](https://fmhy.net/gaming#revival-projects). Also turned Special Interest into its own head category to help organize TOC better.

- Re-ordered [Manga Sites](https://fmhy.net/reading#manga) based on poll results from our Discord. Weeb Central has been moved to #1 spot, and MangaFire + MangaNato have both been starred. Thank you to everyone who took part in voting and gave their thoughts. [Before vs After](https://i.ibb.co/j9Sn4hRR/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/u8zFZTX.png).

- Cleaned up multiple Audio Streaming sections, and added new ones to help better organize it including: [Specialty](https://fmhy.net/audio#specialty-streaming), [Genre Specific](https://fmhy.net/audio#genre-specific-streaming), [Radio Directories](https://fmhy.net/audio#radio-directories), and [Lofi Radio](https://fmhy.net/audio#lofi-radio). [Before vs. After](https://github.com/fmhy/edit/pull/4128#issuecomment-3476036920). Thank you to @AnarchyDR for doing this.

- Updated [Audio Streaming](https://fmhy.net/audio) table of contents to make it less cluttered and easier to navigate. [Before vs After](https://i.ibb.co/0yJbh03H/234243.jpg) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/fhgqKzb.png).

- Cleaned up [Browser Emulators](https://fmhy.net/gaming#browser-emulators), fixed labels, removed dead sites, bumped sites with multiple, or unique emulators higher, and moved any only serving as EmulatorJS / NeptunJS frontends to storage. [Before vs After](https://i.ibb.co/LXdhcDFD/Untitled.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/W9x8jY4.png).

- We removed the "No Torrenting" label from ProtonVPN as you can set it up with a OpenVPN config that allows you to torrent for free. Note that they do expire and must be regenerated sometimes. Guide is listed next to [Proton](https://fmhy.net/privacy#vpn). TY to Wispy and others for figuring this out.

- Added [Tetris](https://fmhy.net/gaming#tetris) Section to Gaming.

- Fixed ugly formatting in Game Optimization. [Before vs After](https://i.ibb.co/Vc99kJhh/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/HRPUwL3.png).
