# Wiki Updates

- Added the **[AMOLED Theme](https://i.ibb.co/hx97zL3W/978676.jpg)** / [2](https://i.imgur.com/fMrnGmF.png) to our site as a [Toggle](https://i.ibb.co/pvkfg3hC/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/qF7exKw.png) that can be turned on or off. Thank you to @Land for doing this.

- Built an **[External Search Engine](https://fmhy-search.dev.zenir.tech/)** that should work better in most cases than the built-in VitePress search on our website.

- Added a **[New Backup](https://fmhyclone.pages.dev/)** of FMHY with daily sync, hosted on GitLab. It also includes a backup of the [raw markdown](https://fmhyapi.wispy.qzz.io/single-page) page. We also added another [backup](https://a-fmhy.pages.dev/) of our website that has the aforementioned theme enabled by default.

- The Space section has become a bit hard to navigate (60+ lines), so we've split it into its [own head section](https://fmhy.net/educational#space), with two new subsections: [Astronomy](https://fmhy.net/educational#astronomy) and [Spacecraft](https://fmhy.net/educational#spacecraft). Astronomy covers celestial objects or phenomena in the cosmos. Spacecraft covers rockets, launches, and the ISS. The head section remains for general space-related things like NASA's website, news, etc.

- Remakes / Ports in Gaming had over 80 lines and was disorganized, so we've split it into three new sections to make it more comprehensible: [Decomps / Ports](https://fmhy.net/gaming#decomps-ports), [Remakes / Recreations](https://fmhy.net/gaming#remakes-recreations), and [Revival Projects](https://fmhy.net/gaming#revival-projects). We also turned "Special Interest" into its own head category to organize the TOC better.

- Re-ordered [Manga Sites](https://fmhy.net/reading#manga) based on poll results from our Discord. Weeb Central has moved to the #1 spot, and MangaFire + MangaNato have both been starred. Thank you to everyone who voted. [Before vs. After](https://i.ibb.co/j9Sn4hRR/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/u8zFZTX.png).

- Cleaned up multiple Audio Streaming sections and added new ones to improve organization, including: [Specialty](https://fmhy.net/audio#specialty-streaming), [Genre-Specific](https://fmhy.net/audio#genre-specific-streaming), [Radio Directories](https://fmhy.net/audio#radio-directories), and [Lofi Radio](https://fmhy.net/audio#lofi-radio). [Before vs. After](https://github.com/fmhy/edit/pull/4128#issuecomment-3476036920). Thank you to @AnarchyDR for this work.

- Updated the [Audio Streaming](https://fmhy.net/audio) Table of Contents to make it less cluttered and easier to navigate. [Before vs. After](https://i.ibb.co/0yJbh03H/234243.jpg) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/fhgqKzb.png).

- Cleaned up [Browser Emulators](https://fmhy.net/gaming#browser-emulators), fixed labels, removed dead sites, and moved any sites only serving as EmulatorJS / NeptunJS frontends to storage. [Before vs. After](https://i.ibb.co/LXdhcDFD/Untitled.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/W9x8jY4.png).

- We removed the "No Torrenting" label from Proton VPN as you can now set it up with an OpenVPN config that allows you to torrent for free. Note that these expire and must be regenerated periodically. The guide is listed next to [Proton](https://fmhy.net/privacy#vpn). TY to Wispy and others for figuring this out.

- Added a [Tetris](https://fmhy.net/gaming#tetris) section to Gaming.

- Fixed messy formatting in Game Optimization. [Before vs. After](https://i.ibb.co/Vc99kJhh/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/HRPUwL3.png).
