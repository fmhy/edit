### Wiki Updates

  [Internet](/android-iosguide/#android-internet),
  [Camera](/android-iosguide/#android-camera) and
  [Customization](/android-iosguide/#customization).

- Renamed Multi Hosts to [Multi Server](/videopiracyguide/#multi-server),
  Dedicated Hosts to [Single Server](/videopiracyguide/#single-server), and

  section in Non-Eng, as most host content for more than one language.

### Things Removed

- Removed Bromite as they've [stopped updates](https://i.imgur.com/uM3ryHR.png),
  and replaced it with [Cromite](https://github.com/uazo/cromite) which will
  continue to be updated by one of their devs.

- Removed AI Text Detectors as they're known for
  [being inaccurate](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/openai-discontinues-its-ai-writing-detector-due-to-low-rate-of-accuracy/).

- Unstarred SoftArchive in Software as people have become annoyed with their
  slow hosts.

- Unstarred LookMovie in Streaming as people don't like the fact 1080p is behind
  premium.

- Unstarred QuickBoost in Tweaking as the app doesn't give details as to what
  each tweak actually does.

- Unstarred Sockshare in Streaming as their original domain died, and it doesn't
  have the best UI anyways.

- Removed AnimeKaizoku from Anime Streaming as they've shutdown.

- Removed DeepFloyd from Image Generators as its been paused for over a month.

- Removed Appnee from Software Sites. The MAS team found that they host many
  [unsafe activators](https://i.imgur.com/KmDKUw4.png). We don't think Appnee is
  purposefully malicious, they just need to be more careful and clean things up
  before we can add them again.
