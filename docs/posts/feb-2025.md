- Moved [Collaboration Platforms](https://fmhy.net/misc#collaboration-platforms) out of storage, cleaned up the section, and added labels.

- For individual notes, we've stopped linking to pastebins and instead link to our own [GitHub page](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHY/wiki/FMHY‐Notes.md). 

- Added a [Site Grading System](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHY/wiki/Stream-Site-Grading) for streaming to help sort them more fairly. This is currently a work in progress, and more categories will be added to further separate sites at the top, such as mobile optimization, ad-free streaming, watch list syncing, and more.
