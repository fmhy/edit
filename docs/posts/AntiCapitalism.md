I think it's important, especially as we get older, to remember that anti-capitalist views are not something we're meant to grow out of. That's a trap so many of us fall into as we get older, and it's a big reason why things never change. It's okay to point out when things are clearly wrong or could be better, even as adults.

Capitalism leads to unhealthy lifestyles and major depression for many people living under it. It creates wars, homelessness, mass incarceration, and mass inequality. It's a system that was built to function for the 1500s, not modern times, and it's not only showing its age but also causing distress, anger, and sadness to the younger generations we're forcing it on.

It is, by definition, forced labor. None of us ever agreed to a lifetime of work. We never said we would. We were not given other options. We're told from the time we're young that *money is the thing with value*, not human life. We're taught that all that really counts is your monetary value. If your monetary value sinks too low, you're no longer "deserving" of the necessities of a human life. You didn't meet the standard set by the man-made economic structure; therefore, you deserve to suffer or even potentially die from overexposure in the streets.

This outdated system takes nearly all the time and energy from those you love and forces them to live their lives in ways they would clearly never otherwise choose. It's a complete joke to call any country forcing its citizens to do things against their will free. It's propaganda, and as long as we live under capitalism, we do not live in free countries. We live under a very old, very outdated system of forced labor. 

Every human on earth deserves food, water, shelter, education, comfort, and happiness BY DEFAULT, no questions asked. People deserve to have freedom of choice in terms of their life and how it looks, without being threatened with homelessness.
