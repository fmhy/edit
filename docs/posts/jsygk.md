I'm not ever going to let this project die. 

Even if something were to happen to me, it would be in good hands thanks to the awesome mods in discord. I just wanted to say this because sometimes projects like this end up slowly dying, and that isn't going to happen with us. 

Giving as many people as possible access to educational material and entertainment does make the world a smarter and happier place. Sharing is, always has been, and always will be the right thing to do, and until we live in a world that doesn't need to be shown that, we'll be here.
