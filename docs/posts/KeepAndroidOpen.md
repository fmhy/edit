### Android will become a locked-down platform in less than 200 days.

In August 2025, Google announced that as of September 2026, it will no longer be possible to develop apps for the Android platform **without first registering centrally with Google**. This registration will involve:

- Paying a fee to Google
- Agreeing to Google’s Terms and Conditions
- Providing government identification
- Uploading evidence of the developer’s private signing key
- Listing all current and future application identifiers

***

### What this means for you

- You will no longer be able to choose what software you run on your phone. You will be forced only to use apps that Google has deemed okay for you to install.

- Creators / developers will no longer be able to make or share apps without first seeking the permission of Google, which will vastly limit the amount of good apps that exist, similar to Apple's ecosystem.

### How you can help

**Developers: Resist and refuse**

If you are an app developer, *do not sign up* for the early access program, perform identity verification, or accept an invitation to the Android Developer Console. Respond (politely) to any invitation with a list of your concerns and objections.

It is only through developer acquiescence and capitulation that their takeover plan can possibly succeed.

Discourage fellow app developers and organizations from signing up to the program. Use community forums, social media, and blog posts to spread the message. Include the [FreeDroidWarn library](https://github.com/woheller69/FreeDroidWarn) in your code to inform your app users. If you manage a web site, consider adding the [countdown banner](https://keepandroidopen.org/banner) to the top of your page.

If you are a Google employee or contractor of good conscience and have additional insight about the program, including planned technical implementation details or additional rationales for the program, please reach out to `tips@keepandroidopen.org` from a non-work machine and a non-gmail account. Your information will be kept in strict confidence.

### Everyone: Make your voice heard

- [Install F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) on your Android device(s) (or similar [FOSS installers](https://fmhy.pages.dev/mobile#foss-apks)). The more people that use alternative app marketplaces, the harder it will be to shut them out.
- Provide feedback directly to Google using their [Android developer verification requirements survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfN3UQeNspQsZCO2ITkdzMxv81rJDEGGjO-UIDDY28Rz_GEVA/viewform?pli=1).
- Make your voice heard on social media and with blog posts, and link to https://keepandroidopen.org
- Combat astroturfing: when you encounter suspect posts on community forums and social media in support of the policy (“Well, actually…”), challenge them and do not be shy.
-Help this project out by [editing this page](https://github.com/keepandroidopen/keepandroidopen.github.io/blob/main/src/content/pages/en/index.md) with more useful information.

###  Consumers: Contact national regulators

**[List of Regulators](https://keepandroidopen.org/)** (at bottom)

Regulators worldwide are genuinely concerned about monopolies and the centralization of power in the tech sector, and want to hear directly from individuals who are affected and concerned. When contacting regulators directly, you should be polite and specific about the harm you believe these policies will cause, both to consumers and to competition.

Complaints are especially impactful when they are authored by a citizen of that country or region, and when the language of the email is written in one of the official languages of the region's governing body. Request a written acknowledgement of the complaint, and consider forwarding any responses you receive to `victory@keepandroidopen.org` so that we might highlight and reference them.
