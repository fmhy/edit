- Starred [TizenTube Cobalt](https://fmhy.net/video#android-tv) in Android TV. Ad-free YouTube app, updated often, has SponsorBlock support, and uses the official YouTube UI.

- Starred [Watch Footy](https://fmhy.net/video#live-sports) in Live Sports. Solid sources, nice UI, and lots of events.

# Things Removed

- Removed Anadius as they've [decided to step down](https://i.ibb.co/TD9kRCR3/image.png) / [2](https://i.imgur.com/2Xk8Jor.png). It may be re-added in the future if someone new steps up to maintain it.

- Removed ContextSearch as it's been removed by Firefox. It seems to be causing issues, and in some cases flooding sites with requests. We're unsure if it's purposefully malicious or a mistake by its developer, but regardless, it's recommended to remove it and try other options like [ContextSearch web-ext](https://fmhy.net/internet-tools#firefox-extensions).

- Unstarred [Files](https://fmhy.net/file-tools#file-managers) in File Managers. There was a lot of hype for this originally, but people have started to come forward saying it's too laggy / slow to be useful.

- Unstarred Grok, Qwen, Mage, and Flux.1 Schnell in [Image Gen](https://fmhy.net/ai#image-generation). These were considered good in the past, but there are much better, less-dated free options at this point.
