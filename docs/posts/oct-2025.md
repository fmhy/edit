# Wiki Updates

- Reorganized [Download Sites](https://fmhy.net/downloading#download-sites), retested each, bumped ones with faster hosts higher, moved any that fit other sections better, removed dead or premium-only, and fixed inaccurate labels. [Before vs. After](https://i.imgur.com/B2kJ23O.png).

- Reorganized [Programming Learning](https://fmhy.net/educational#programming-languages), removed outdated sites, and fixed bad formatting.  [Before vs. After](https://i.imgur.com/LE1ozRI.png).

- Reworked all our VPN + Proxy sections. There was too much to fit into a "before vs after" image, but you can see all of the changes in the [pull request](https://github.com/fmhy/edit/pull/4108/files) by Wispy.

- Fixed formatting in [Android Camera Tools](https://fmhy.net/mobile#android-camera), turned it into its own head section, and added new subsections for [Image Editing](https://fmhy.net/mobile#image-tools) + [Image Galleries](https://fmhy.net/mobile#image-galleries) to make it easier to navigate.

- Added PWA (Progressive Web App) support to our website. This means our site can be added to your home screen or desktop like an app. It can (in theory) allow a smoother experience when browsing the site. For mobile it may prompt, or you can add it by selecting ["Add to Home Screen"](https://i.imgur.com/JgyjqBI.png). For desktop, simply hit the [PWA icon](https://i.imgur.com/gcu8r0U.png) in the address bar.

- Updated Windscribe's description to "No Torrenting w/ Free Version" as they can no longer [afford to keep it running](https://redd.it/1nos1a9). We've also bumped it below Proton, as Proton is unlimited despite having the same no torrent limitation.

- Starred [QQDL](https://fmhy.net/audio#audio-ripping-sites) in Audio Ripping. Has fast, single click FLAC downloads. Seems to be one of the more consistent options.

- Starred [Virgil Software Search](https://fmhy.net/downloading#software-sites) in Software Sites. Custom multi-site software search engine, only uses trusted sites already listed on FMHY.

- Starred [Kimi](https://fmhy.net/ai#official-model-sites) in AI Chatbots. Good free limits, highest rated open-source model on LMArena, adding K2 reasoning soon.

- Starred [Kagane](https://fmhy.net/reading#manga) in Manhwa / Manga. Big library, no compression, nice UI, can toggle SFW / NSFW.

- Starred [MangaBaka](https://fmhy.net/reading#tracking-database) in Manga / Light Novel Tracking. Has expansive, detailed database, and nice UI, seems to be well liked so far.

# Things Removed

- Removed Comick as they had to [remove all of their content](https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy/s/NInzfJ7GUK). Such a huge amount of material, both popular, and obscure, has been ripped from the internet. Truly unfortunate. They will be very missed. Thank you to Comick for all the years of making peoples lives better.

- Removed ReVanced in Android Audio as it [no longer blocks spotify ads](https://torrentfreak.com/revanced-complies-with-spotify-takedown-but-explores-options-to-fight-back/), and instead moved it to YouTube Music, as it still works fine for that.

- Removed Canva Pro telegram invite, it's gone and we don't have a new link for it. That was our last working Canva Pro method, so it might be awhile before we find an alt. 

- Unstarred Cobalt (in audio ripping, not video) as it's soundcloud + newgrounds only, making it less useful than it was. 

- Unstarred Koalageddon in DLC unlockers, as v1/v2 are both archived and no longer updated.
