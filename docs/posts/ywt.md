Hello everyone. I hope you are all doing well. I just wanted to take a quick moment to talk about two concepts I think are becoming important in our world: rebellion and disobedience.

***

I feel now more than ever, people are realizing the amount of power we average everyday humans have collectively. People are seeing that when we're together, when we speak as one, there is no authoritarian, no warmonger, no politician, no king, no army, no country on earth who's going to stand in our way. That does not mean things are perfect or that there is not a lot of work ahead, but I believe people have recognized a shift to a better world is actually possible. A world of more equality, of more freedom, of more pure unconditional love towards each other.

Though we have an uphill climb, I am very grateful and humbled to be alive during such an important time in human history. I truly believe that a change is occurring within us as a species; many have now taken a big enough step back to see the true faces of the oppressors of this world. Friedrich Hegel once said: *"There is no better sign of our time than the fact that mankind portrays itself as being so worthy of respect. It is a proof that the aura surrounding the oppressors and the gods of this earth is fading."*

If FMHY has inspired anything, I hope it's inspired some of you to not be afraid to stand up for things you know are right, even when it's extremely difficult. Even when everything feels stacked against you, when you think no one will listen, STAND UP. Stand strong. **Your voice counts**. Your opinions count. It's in our very nature as humans to rebel and disobey those who oppress, belittle, bully, and abuse their unwarranted powers.

Rebellion isn't something that only happens in history books.

* *"Disobedience, in the eyes of anyone who has read history, is humanity's original virtue."* - Oscar Wilde

* *"To revolt is a natural tendency of life. Even a worm turns against the foot that crushes it. In general, the vitality and relative dignity of an animal can be measured by the intensity of its instinct to revolt"* - Mikhail Bakunin 

* *"So I decided to become a midwife… I wanted to deliver a thousand babies. And as each one arrives, especially the little girls, I’ll be there first to whisper into her tender little ear: REBEL! REBEL!”* - Emma Goldman

* *"The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion."* - Albert Camus
