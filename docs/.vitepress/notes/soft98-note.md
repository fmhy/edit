#### Soft98 Note

Enable the `AdGuard - Ads` filter list in uBlock to allow downloads to work. To remove all ads, you can also get the [AdGuard Extra Userscript](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardExtra?tab=readme-ov-file#userscript) (not the extension) and enable it in your [userscript manager](https://fmhy.net/internet-tools#userscripts). Note that you may need to disable filter `ir: PersianBlocker`.
