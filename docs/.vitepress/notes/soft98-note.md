#### Soft98 Note

Enable `AdGuard - Ads` filterlist in uBlock to allow downloads to work. To remove all ads, you can also get the [AdGuard Extra Userscript](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardExtra?tab=readme-ov-file#userscript) (not the extension) and enable it in your script manager. Note that you may need to disable filter `ir: PersianBlocker`.
