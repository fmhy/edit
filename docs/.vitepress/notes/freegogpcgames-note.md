#### FreeGOGPCGames Note

Many titles on the site are the older versions of the installers. The digital signature on the installer is signed by GOG Limited, which is the old company name before it was merged with GOG Sp. z o.o and all digital file signatures were updated to reflect this name change.
 
The hash does not match the gog-games database because the digital file signatures differ on the installer. Installing either version will produce identical sets of files since the game version remains unchanged.
