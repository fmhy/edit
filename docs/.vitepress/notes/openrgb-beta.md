#### OpenRGB Beta

The latest stable release dates from July 9 2023, so it is lacking support for many devices. You may want to use a newer experimental release instead.

* Supported devices for the latest stable release (0.9): https://openrgb.org/devices_0.9.html
* Supported devices for the latest experimental release: https://openrgb.org/devices.html

To use an experimental release go to https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB and in the left sidebar go to `Build` -> `Pipelines`, then click the download icon for a pipeline that has three green checkmarks, and pick the appropriate version for your computer.
