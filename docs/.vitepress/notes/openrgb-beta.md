#### OpenRGB Beta

How to download OpenRGB beta.
 
Why?
  Because the latest version that you can download from the website dates from July 9 2023, and since a new device is added to the software almost every day, using the beta version becomes a necessity.
 
Go to Gitlab OpenRgb site `https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB` and on the left go to Build => Pipelines and then download the appropriate version from the download button on the top right.
(Note: Before downloading it should say Passed at the top left.)
