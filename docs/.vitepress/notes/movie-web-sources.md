#### Adding sources to P-Stream (and all movie-web forks)

You can [enable an extension](https://docs.pstream.mov/extension) that will add more sources, but it needs to connect to all sites to function. The extension is safe, and many people use it, the permissions are just needed in order for the [extension to work correctly](https://rentry.co/htagcrv4). 

Note that you can run it in a new browser or fresh browser profile if you don't want to use your main browser.
