#### Māori Note

Māori is the indigenous language of mainland New Zealand. Due to the [Native Schools Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language#Suppression_and_decline) in 1867, children were forbidden to speak it in the classroom, under penalty of corporal punishment, which led to a rapid decline of speakers. There are now [revitalization efforts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language_revival) (such as Tōku Reo) attempting to promote and reinforce its use.
