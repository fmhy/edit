This site uses credits ("magicubes") to generate images and videos, you get 100 daily. It costs 2 magicubes per image for Qwen, 1 for Z-Image, and 28 for Wan 2.2 14b I2V. Linking an Alibaba Cloud account (free, ignore the final part of account setup where it asks for payment info and link the account anyways) gets you 50 extra magicubes daily.
