#### Yet Another Call Blocker Note

The app itself isn't updated, but the blocklists are. It has a main local blocklist by default, and if you have "Auto-update database" enabled the app receives daily blocklist updates directly from third-party services. More info in their [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/xynngh/YetAnotherCallBlocker#yet-another-call-blocker).
